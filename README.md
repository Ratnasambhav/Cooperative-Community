# Cooperative-Community
Python project to find communities in a social network using co-location data.

This project confers about various methods of discovering communities in a social network contained inside a particular location or organization. Community detection in such social networks is a difficult task because of its complexity, rapid rate of change, size and high number of linkages between different nodes. The paper proposes a Community Detection Method to discover communities in a closed social network using 2 metrics: Friendship and Colocation Metrics. At the end the efficiency of community detection can be modified by using a threshold ‘k’.

Additional details can be found in the accompnied [report](https://github.com/Ratnasambhav/Cooperative-Community/blob/master/Report.pdf) on the project.
